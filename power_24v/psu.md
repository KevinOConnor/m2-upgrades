This documents an upgrade of the Makergear M2 power supply to 24V.

I printed the power supply holder at
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4491723 .  Printed in PETG
with 0.280mm layer height.

I purchased a "MEAN WELL LRS-350-24 350W 24V power supply" ($29 from
Amazon).  It is my understanding that there are forgeries of the MEAN
WELL power supplies, so although I purchased from Amazon I made sure
it was "sold by Amazon" and not from their marketplace.

I purchased an "IEC320 socket" ($12 for 2-pack from Amazon) and made
sure that it included wires that were already crimped.

To assist in the wiring I also purchased a pack of "fork spade wire
connectors" ($7 for 100-pack from Amazon).  Otherwise I reused
existing wires to connect the new power supply to the electronics
board.
