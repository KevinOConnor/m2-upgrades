This documents an upgrade of the Makergear M2 electronics.

I used a Duet2 Maestro board for the electronics.  In order to improve
cooling, I mounted the electronics vertically on the outside of the M2
frame.

I designed a [holder for the board](m2-maestro.stl).  I printed in
PLA.

As part of the new electronics, it was necessary to redo the "wire
harness".  That involved cutting nearly all the zip ties on the
existing wires, connecting the wires to the new electronics, applying
new zip ties to bundle the wires, and then reapplying the wire
shrouds.

Caveats:

* I have not yet designed a cover for the electronics.
