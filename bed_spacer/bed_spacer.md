This documents an upgrade of the glass grip on the Makergear M2 heated
bed platform.

The rubber pads on the four corners of the M2 Y-axis "spider" mount
did not do a good job of gripping the glass plate.

I designed small [spacers](m2-bed-rubber-spacer.stl) so the L-shaped
rubber pad would be at a higher position and the glass would sit
between the L-shaped rubber pad instead of on top of it.  Printed in
PETG with 0.200mm layer height and 80% infill.  I use M3x16mm screws
(instead of M3x14mm) and arrange the bed corners so that (from bottom
to top) there is the aluminum spider, the rubber square pad, the
plastic spacer, the L-shaped rubber pad, a metal washer, and then the
M3 screw.

Note that the spacer height was adjusted for the thicker cork board on
my heated bed platform after performing the 24V upgrade.
