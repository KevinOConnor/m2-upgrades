This documents an upgrade of the grip on the Makergear M2 heated bed
platform.

The rubber pads on the four corners of the M2 Y-axis "spider" mount
did not do a good job of gripping the glass plate.

I designed small [spacers](m2-bed-rubber-spacer.stl) so the rubber pad
would be at a higher position and have a better grip on the glass.  I
printed four of them in PLA.
