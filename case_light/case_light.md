This documents describes an LED case light upgrade to the Makergear
M2.

In order to have better visibility of the printed part during
printing, I added LEDs to the top of the M2 frame.  The LEDs are
underneath the X axis aluminum plate and shine down towards the print
area.

I designed an [LED holder](m2-led-holder.stl).  It is printed in ABS
with 0.200mm layer height.  The holder is screwed to the frame using
the two existing M4 screws that secure the top aluminum plate to the
steel frame.

For the LEDs, I purchased a "24V white LED strip without power supply"
($9 for 5 meters / 300 LEDs from Amazon).  I cut five 200mm sections
from the strip and then soldered wires to them.  I soldered those five
pairs of wires into one pair of wires and then connected that to the
"E1 mosfet" on the electronics.
