This documents an upgrade of the Makergear M2 so that one can mount a
Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi camera module to it.

I printed the Raspberry Pi case at:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2342050 along with brackets from:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2342080 .  Printed in PETG
with 0.200mm layer height and 20% infill.  I mounted the case
vertically along the right side of the M2 frame (just under the X
stepper motor).

For the Raspberry Pi camera module, I designed a
[camera holder](m2-rpi-camera.stl).  Printed in PETG with 0.200mm
layer height and 20% infill.  The holder is mounted inside the M2
steel frame on the upper right side.

Caveats:

* The camera picks up some glare from the LED lights and it's position
  isn't able to see the nozzle when the X carriage is near the X
  maximum.
